### Angular JS Project
[JediahDizon.Github.io](https://JediahDizon.Github.io) - Work in Progress

I took a Udemy course in Angular JS alongside many other subjects. What interest me in this learning curve is the fact that the power of Javascript can literally allow software developers make a web application that communicates to servers all over the world in less than an hour. I learned the famous MV* framework and with hands-on experience and despite finishing the course, I still have yet to learn.

### Dependencies
- Angular JS - https://angularjs.org
- Bootstrap with Material Design Framework - https://mdbootstrap.com
- Bootstrap Ladda - https://github.com/msurguy/ladda-bootstrap
- Bootstrap Toggle - http://www.bootstraptoggle.com

### To Do List
- Use an image search API to change the city image whenever the user specifies a different city for the weather information
- Use RSS feeds to parse and display RSS information on specified websites
- Make a pull request to the Bootstrap Toggle so that the toggle switch's button center button's color is also modifiable and not just the On/Off button.

Bootstrap Toggle has button elements on the left, center, and right. The center buttons color is limited to just Bootstrap's "Default" button color. Since Bootstrap MD has it's "Default" color set to green, it just looks horrendous.

### Current Screenshot
- Weather Functionality presentation has been improved
- RSS Feed functionality has been implemented
