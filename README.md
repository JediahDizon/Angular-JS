### Angular JS Project
I took a Udemy course in Angular JS alongside many other subjects. What interest me in this learning curve is the fact that the power of Javascript can literally allow software developers make a web application that communicates to servers all over the world in less than an hour. I learned the famous MV* framework and with hands-on experience and despite finishing the course, I still have yet to learn.

### Dependencies
- Angular JS - https://angularjs.org
- Bootstrap with Material Design Framework - https://mdbootstrap.com
- Bootstrap Ladda - https://github.com/msurguy/ladda-bootstrap
- Bootstrap Toggle - http://www.bootstraptoggle.com

### To Do List
- Use an image search API to change the city image whenever the user specifies a different city for the weather information
- Use RSS feeds to parse and display RSS information on specified websites
- Make it look nicer than it is now
