### Angular JS Project
I took a Udemy course in Angular JS alongside many other subjects. What interest me in this learning curve is the fact that the power of Javascript can literally allow software developers make a web application that communicates to servers all over the world in less than an hour. I learned the famous MV* framework and with hands-on experience and despite finishing the course, I still have yet to learn.
